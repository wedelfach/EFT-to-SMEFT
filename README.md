# EFT-to-SMEFT
_______________________________
This repository stores the code that substitutes SMEFT group invariants into general results available on arXiv: 2501.17134.

The "Definitions" directory contains the files W_def.nb and couplings_def.nb, which were used to generate binary files with definitions of couplings and W-symbol elements. The Wn directories contain notebooks implementing the substitution algorithm for SMEFT operators.

The SU(3) group constants were not substituted since the only non-trivial part of the results originates from the U(1)×SU(2)U(1)×SU(2) part of the theory.

The general results for W6W6​ and W9W9​ RGEs depend on the same combinations of group invariants as those for W5W5​ and W8W8​. Therefore, the derivation of their SMEFT variants follows immediately.
